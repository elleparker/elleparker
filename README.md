My dad said I wouldn't amount to anything. I guess he was right!

Areas of Focus:

	•	Full-Stack Development: Building both the frontend and backend of dynamic applications.
	•	UX/UI Design: Crafting beautiful, intuitive interfaces that prioritize user experience.
	•	Mobile Apps: Developing responsive and cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and React Native.
 A touch of that pizzaaaaz! :)
 
Tools & Technologies I Use:

	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, SASS
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express, Python, Ruby on Rails
	•	Databases: Firebase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
	•	Mobile: React Native, Flutter

I'm not a hardcore coder, but I learned everything I know  by watching Youtube and got my first Bugcrowd Bug Bounty only one year later.
