Hey there! I’m Ell, a developer with a creative flair. I specialize in full-stack development, UX/UI design, and integrating cutting-edge technologies to create seamless, user-friendly applications. I believe that good code is as much about functionality as it is about making technology accessible and enjoyable to use.

Areas of Focus:

	•	Full-Stack Development: Building both the frontend and backend of dynamic applications.
	•	UX/UI Design: Crafting beautiful, intuitive interfaces that prioritize user experience.
	•	Mobile Apps: Developing responsive and cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and React Native.

Tools & Technologies I Use:

	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, SASS
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express, Python, Ruby on Rails
	•	Databases: Firebase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
	•	Mobile: React Native, Flutter

I enjoy learning new tools and pushing the limits of what’s possible with code. Whether you’re interested in contributing to a project or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!
